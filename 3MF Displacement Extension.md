# Preface

## 1.1. About this Specification

This 3MF displacement specification is an extension to the core 3MF specification. This document cannot stand alone and only applies as an addendum to the core 3MF specification. Usage of this and any other 3MF extensions follow an a la carte model, defined in the core 3MF specification.

Part I, "3MF Documents," presents the details of the primarily XML-based 3MF Document format. This section describes the XML markup that defines the composition of 3D documents and the appearance of each model within the document.

Part II, "Appendixes," contains additional technical details and schemas too extensive to include in the main body of the text as well as convenient reference information.

The information contained in this specification is subject to change. Every effort has been made to ensure its accuracy at the time of publication.

This extension MUST be used only with Core specification 1.x.

## 1.2. Document Conventions

Except where otherwise noted, syntax descriptions are expressed in the ABNF format as defined in RFC 4234.

Glossary terms are formatted like _this_.

Syntax descriptions and code are formatted in `monospace` type.

Replaceable items, that is, an item intended to be replaced by a value, are formatted in _`monospace cursive`_ type.

Notes are formatted as follows:

>**Note:** This is a note.

## 1.3. Language Notes

In this specification, the words that are used to define the significance of each requirement are written in uppercase. These words are used in accordance with their definitions in RFC 2119, and their respective meanings are reproduced below:

- _MUST._ This word, or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.
- _SHOULD._ This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
- _MAY._ This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is truly optional. For example, one implementation may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace or scenario requires it or because it enhances the product. Another implementation may omit the same item.

## 1.4. Software Conformance

Most requirements are expressed as format or package requirements rather than implementation requirements.

In order for consumers to be considered conformant, they must observe the following rules:

- They MUST NOT report errors when processing conforming instances of the document format except when forced to do so by resource exhaustion.
- They SHOULD report errors when processing non-conforming instances of the document format when doing so does not pose an undue processing or performance burden.

In order for producers to be considered conformant, they must observe the following rules:

- They MUST NOT generate any new, non-conforming instances of the document format.
- They MUST NOT introduce any non-conformance when modifying an instance of the document format.

Editing applications are subject to all of the above rules.



# Part I: 3MF Documents

# Chapter 1. Overview of Additions

| ![Sphere Mesh](images/overview_1.png) | ![Sphere mesh with greyscale displacement](images/overview_2.png) | ![Retesselated Sphere mesh](images/overview_3.png) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Sphere mesh (27.500 triangles, 411kB). | Sphere mesh with greyscale displacement map (27.500 triangles, 1.2MB) | Retesselated Sphere mesh (660.000 triangles, 12.1MB)|

The rationale of the displacement specification extension is to enhance mesh geometry by a displacement mapping.
This is achieved by assigning a displacements to the conventional 3D mesh geometry and a scalar map that describes the offset in the direction of the displacement vector.
This allows a very memory effective, accurate description of complex geometry.

This means that a displacement information of a triangle is given by
- UV coordinates for each corner
- A scalar 2D image for representing the "heightmap"
- A displacement direction for each corner which can be interpolated linearly on the surface

| ![Triangle with displacement vectors and depth](images/displacement_triangle.png) | ![Texture referenced by triangle](images/displacement_scalar.png) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Triangle with displacement vectors and depth encoded in texture. | Texture referenced by triangle. The region referenced by the UV coordinates is highlighted. |

TODO: comparision to/distinction from normal mapping, bump mapping

This document describes new elements, each of which is OPTIONAL for producers, but MUST be supported by consumers that specify support for this displacement extension of 3MF.

# Chapter 2. Resources


## 2.1 Displacement2D
Element **\<displacement2d>**

![Displacement2D XML structure](images/xsd_displacement.png)

| Name   | Type   | Use   | Default   | Annotation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | **ST\_ResourceID** | required |   | ResourceID of this displacement resource |
| path | **ST\_UriReference** | required |   | path to the gray scale displacement texture |
| contenttype | **ST\_ContentType** | required |   | Content type of texture resource. PNG or JPEG allowed|

TODO:
- encoding in grayscale 8 / 16 bit. Must be grayscale PNG. what if not? fallback to generate grayscale?
- relationship to texture2d?

## 2.2 Disp2DGroup
Element **\<disp2dgroup>**

![Disp2dGroup XML structure](images/xsd_disp2dgroup.png)

| Name   | Type   | Use   | Default   | Annotation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | **ST\_ResourceID** | required |   | ResourceID of this Disp2dGroup resource |
| dispid | **ST\_ResourceID** | required |   | ID of the Displacement map used in this group |
| depth | **ST\_Number** | required |   | Scaling factor for the values in the displacement map |

TODO:
- Tilestyle?
- simply use a regular texture?
- OPC relationship: texture 


## 2.2.1 Disp2DCoords
Element **\<disp2dcoords>**

![Disp2dCoords XML structure](images/xsd_disp2dcoords.png)

| Name   | Type   | Use   | Default   | Annotation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| u | **ST\_Number** | required |   | The u-coordinate within the texture, horizontally right from the origin in the lower left of the texture. |
| v | **ST\_Number** | required |   | The v-coordinate within the texture, vertically up from the origin in the lower left of the texture.|
| nx | **ST\_Number** | required |   | X-component of the displacement vector. |
| ny | **ST\_Number** | required |   | Y-component of the displacement vector. |
| nz | **ST\_Number** | required |   | Z-component of the displacement vector. |

TODO:
- Normalization of nx, ny, nz? 

# Chapter 3. Usage rules and interpretation
TODO:
- depth > / < 0 => unification / intersection of volumes
- Normal field illustration
- Normal field is not a normal field. Consistently call it displacement field?
- Should consumers clip with simple or fine geometry?
- Consistent with multiproperties?
- Do we need a "target resolution"?

# Part II. Appendixes

**3D model.** The markup that defines a model for output.

**3D Model part.** The OPC part that contains a 3D model.

**3D Texture part.** A file used to apply complex information to a 3D object in the 3D Model part. In this extension spec, it is specifically a TBMP file.

**3MF.** The 3D Manufacturing Format described by this specification, defining one or more 3D objects intended for output to a physical form.

**3MF Document.** The digital manifestation of an OPC package that contains a 3D payload that conforms with the 3MF specification.

**Composite material.** A material that is comprised of a ratio of other materials.

**Consumer.** A software, service, or device that reads in a 3MF Document.

**Editor.** A software, service, or device that both reads in and writes out 3MF Documents, possibly changing the content in between.

**Material.** The description of a physical substance that can be used to output an object.

**Material resource.** A potential resource that might be referenced by an object to describe what the object will be made of.

**Producer.** A software, service, or device that writes out a 3MF Document.

**Resource.** A texture, color, material, action, or object that could be used by another resource or might be necessary to build a physical 3D object according to build instructions.
